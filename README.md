# RogueLike, aka Ship_game
RogueLike - it is a 2d top down ASCII based roguelike, where you take a role of adventrurer, that decided to go down in the dungeon. Along the way you will find a lot of dangers and enemies. Killing them will reward you with experience, that will increase your level and stats. Also, deeper you go into the dungeon, better loot you will find, even some enchanted weapons

It is my first ever game. I made it when I was in 10 garde - I was 15 then. Firstly, I wanted to make a game about ships, but in the end I scrapped that idea and decided to make my game a riguelike - genre that I always love. Also, it was my first, proper introduction to the Classes in C#. I didn't konw how to use them properly, so you will see some pretty dirty code there. Also, the main issue with the game was that, I had to clean the whole screen and then draw it again. Cleaning more several thousand lines, that was a height of 30 lines, every time player makes a move - is painful to watch, and also it slows down dramatically when you perform lot of actions

Feel free to play it)
